# Bernoulli Distribution 🧑‍💻📊

This project demonstrates how to work with the Bernoulli distribution using Python. It generates and visualizes Bernoulli-distributed random variables, providing insights into their behavior and applications.

## 📂 Files

The project contains a Jupyter notebook file:

- `Bernoulli_Distribution.ipynb`: The main notebook that demonstrates the creation and visualization of Bernoulli-distributed random variables.

## 📦 Requirements

To run the code, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`: For numerical operations and generating random numbers. ⚙️
- `matplotlib`: For visualizing the distribution in the form of plots. 📈
- `scipy`: For statistical functions and distribution tools. 🔬

You can install the necessary libraries with:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

## 📝 Description
1. **Bernoulli Distribution**: Understanding the behavior of a random variable that can take only two possible outcomes: success (1) and failure (0).
2. **Visualization**: A plot to visually represent the Bernoulli distribution.
3. **KDE Plot**: A Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plot to estimate the probability density function.
4. **Statistical Insights**: Calculating and visualizing the probability of success (p) for Bernoulli trials.

## 📊 Usage
To see the Bernoulli distribution in action, run the Bernoulli_Distribution.ipynb file. It will generate plots and explain the underlying principles of the distribution.
